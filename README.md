# CampaignQR
A Web App automate poster campaigns with actual analytics

## Intention
I would like to generate a bunch of QR codes that redirects to a single url for a poster advertisement campaign. 
The web app should be able to take in an image of the poster and let the user enter a url which will be turn into n different QR codes linking to randomized links created on the backend, and the QR code can then be repositioned on the images of posters by the user. Then on a press of a button n posters with different QR codes will be downloaded.
